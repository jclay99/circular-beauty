        <p>
            In 2018 alone, the beauty industry produced 7.9 billion units of rigid plastic for cosmetics and personal care products. 
            Many contributors to the beauty industry claim that they recycle used plastic containers, but the sad reality is that only 
            9 percent of the plastic that is consumed is recycled or remade into new products. Needless to say, the beauty industry is 
            in serious need of a change.

            That’s where we come in. We at Circular Beauty are committed to reducing the raging rates of plastic consumption by the beauty 
            industry and creating sustainable solutions to storing and packaging all cosmetic and personal care products. We believe that, 
            through creative thinking and innovation in the beauty industry, our team can demystify the idea of green or sustainable beauty, 
            one step at a time.

            We started as a project team in a product design class focused on taking an iconic plastic product and creating a circular 
            economy around it. From there, Circular Beauty has blossomed into so much more: a brand, a business, and most importantly, a 
            competitor in the beauty industry. We are excited to welcome you on our journey to demystify green beauty and create sustainable 
            solutions to the world’s beauty and personal care needs!
